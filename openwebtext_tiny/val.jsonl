{"text": "Ijen Volcano Crater is one of the most attractive and dangerous places in the world. Active volcano, constantly spewing sulfur smoke clubs, the world\u2019s largest acid lake Kawah Ijen, incredible in its beauty blue fire and extremely hard working conditions in the sulfur mine. We went down into the crater to see everything with our own eyes. The Ijen volcanic complex consists of several stratovolcanoes and cinder cones and a 20 km wide caldera. Ijen caldera is the largest in Java. The size of the crater is about 960 m x 600 m. The primary dangers at Ijen are pyroclastic flows, lahars, and lava flows. But tourists are interested in the acidic crater lake shore which is a natural large deposits of sulfur. Way to Kawah Ijen\n\nIn order to reach the famous lake, you must first climb to the top and then descend into the crater. The way from the ticket office to the top takes about 3 km, the altitude difference is 500 m. If you do not hurry up, the road is rather simple. It\u2019s steeper at the beginning and almost flat after a cafe halfway. Typically an entrance to the crater opens at 1am. But in case of a high activity of the volcano this time can be shifted to the morning or even prohibited for tourists. On the day when we climbed, the entrance opened about 3.45 am. This meant that we had less than an hour to arrive to the crater lake, if we want to see blue fire. We got to the top in about 45 minutes, and another 15 minutes spent on the descent. To be honest, it wasn\u2019t easy for me to move with such speed. And, admittedly, we arrived to late. On the top of Ijen crater we saw a few flashes of blue fire, but when we descent to the lake after 5 am, it was already light. So I could make some pictures with just one blue fire flash on photo. It was too late for a super photo filled with blue light. The road back is very beautiful. Mountain peaks of volcanic complex, a fog and clouds shrouding slopes, scorched trees and dense vegetation of forests and fields are on the way. Is It Dangerous to Visit Ijen Crater? It is impossible to stay a long time close to a dense acid gas without a mask. Olivier Grunewald\n\nYes for sure! Acrid sulfur gas (sulfur dioxide) is very dangerous to health. High temperature near the pipes from which sulfur flows is a life-threatening. For good pictures, I went to the epicenter of heavy whitish-yellow smoke. Despite the mask, it was very difficult to breathe, my eyes filled with tears, workers shouted \u201cDangerous!\u201d after each next step on the slope above the hot liquid sulfur. All day long I \u201cfelt my lungs\u201d. I think that just one such adventure is not terrible, but it\u2019s better do not risk once again. It\u2019s better to be careful when you are going down into the crater. First, be sure to wear a respirator or a protective mask. The more effective it filters the air the better. There are casualties among tourists, who neglected safety rules. Second, keep in mind that the road goes across the rocks. Comfortable shoes and gloves will help you overcome the way. Crater Stunning View\n\nBeing on the slopes of Ijen crater you remember Divine Comedy and 9 circles of hell. Lifeless slopes, flowing red-hot sulfur, clubs of acrid yellow gas rushing from the earth and emerald deadly acid lake with sulfur plumes on the surface. Kawah Ijen Acid Lake\n\nKawah Ijen Crater Lake, at the top of the volcano, is the world\u2019s largest such body of water filled with hydrochloric and sulfuric acid. The volcano emitted hydrogen chloride gas, which reacted with the water and formed a highly condensed hydrochloric acid with a pH of almost 0. In fact, it\u2019s the hydrochlori acid that makes the water turquoise-blue. The lake is a deadly dangerous, however it can be touched by hand. A temperature on the surface is 50-60\u00b0\u0421, and in the depths \u2013 over 200\u00b0\u0421. The depth of the lake is about 200 meters. Blue Fire\n\nThe blue fire is ignited sulphuric gas, which emerges from cracks with temperatures up to 600\u00b0\u0421. The glow is quite weak, so it can be seen only at night. Lava flows burning with blue flame can be seen on the Ijen extremely rare\n\nSometimes sulfur is ignited by the workers. To speed up the formation of the mineral, a mining company installed ceramic pipes on an active vent near the edge of the lake. The pipes route the sulfur gases down the vent\u2019s sloping mound. When the gases cool, they condense into liquid sulfur, which then flows or drips from the pipes and solidifies into hard sulfur mats. Workers sell these stalactites to tourists as souvenirs. Lava flows burning with blue flame can be seen on the Ijen extremely rare. Unfortunately, many websites show pictures of Olivier Grunewald and give the impression, that it happens every night. Don\u2019t believe it! Usually you can see burning sulfur dioxide gas, no lava at all. Sulfur Mines in the Crater\n\nMiners have been extracting sulfur here for more than 40 years. This is a very difficult and dangerous job. Without protective clothing, and without masks, miners cut sulfur pieces and put them into a basket. Then they carry these baskets 200 meters to the top of the crater, and then descend 3 km to the foot of the volcano to a village, where they are rewarded for their work. The weight of such baskets is 60-80 kg, some people manage to lift up to 110 kg. Typically workers do such journey twice a day. For 1 kg of sulfur they get 900-1000 IDR, which means about $ 5 per basket or $ 10 per day. By local standards it\u2019s a highly paid and prestigious job. Java is a very high populated island, a lot of people unemployed. Sulfur miners are a kind of working elite. The best thing you can do for workers is to give a respirator. However, this doesn\u2019t help them live long. Sulfur gas is so dangerous to the health, that young guys look like old men, and the average life expectancy of about 47 years. Despite the extremely hard working conditions, miners are amazingly friendly and cheerful people. I experienced culture shock when a worker with a basket, the weight of which exceeds his own, had step side to let me go. All the time they show tourists a better way across rocks and gladly posed for photographers. The best thing you can do for the workers is to give them a respirator or even a face mask. They have no money and no opportunity to even change the filters. Many workers don\u2019t know that the air they breathe is dangerous. All miners smoke. They say that it helps them to reduce smell of sulfur a little bit. Where to Stay? Usually travellers stay as close to Ijen crater as possible. You can look at Asparin Homestay 1* or Ijen Resort and Villas 3* located near by the volcano. How to Get to Kawah Ijen Volcano from Bali? It\u2019s not difficult to Ijen volcano from Bali. You need to get to the ferry terminal on the west of Bali island, take a ferry to Java island and drive about 2 hours to the foot of the volcano. It\u2019s better to start climbing at night, so plan to spend a night near by the volcano. Most of people combine a trip to Ijen volcano with a trip to the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park and climbing to the top of Bromo crater. In this case, the possible alternative is to arrive in Jogjakarta (Yogyakarta), Surabaya or other town in Central / East Java, and then drive east to the volcanous. But please take into account that the way from Jogjakarta (Yogyakarta) to Bromo may take up to 12 hours.

{"text": "You don't have to go far to find examples of everyday discrimination in Europe. There are Croatian landlords who refuse apartments to lesbians, Belgian cafes that won't serve women in headscarves to \"maintain security,\" French banks who refuse loans to people on disability benefits, German swimming pools that deny access to blind women, and Slovakian clinics that refuse certain treatments for multiple sclerosis patients older than 45. All these examples come from a recent report by Equinet, an umbrella organization for European equality bodies, one of more than 40 organizations that on Thursday issued a fresh call for the European Union to adopt a single anti-discrimination law. \"In many countries, people with disabilities can be refused access to offices, gays and lesbians can be refused hotel rooms, people can be refused rental cars because of their age, and people can be denied rental contracts because of their Jewish or Muslim religious beliefs,\" the organizations said a statement. \"Such differing levels of protection should no longer exist in Europe.\" Disability access is a particular concern across Europe\n\nDifferent standards\n\n\"Europe is a community of values where human rights are upheld, so it shouldn't be that people in different countries get different human rights protection,\" said Maja Liebing, discrimination specialist at the German branch of Amnesty International, which also signed the appeal. \"There is relatively good protection against discrimination on the basis of ethnic background, and I think no one would question that it is important in other areas.\" A draft law has been on the table since 2008 - seven years during which Germany has been holding up negotiations. \"For a long time Germany wasn't the only country to do it, there were others who expressed reservations - but that's changed,\" said Liebing. \"Now Germany really is the only country at the EU level still blocking.\" That is ironic, because Germany has relatively comprehensive discrimination protection laws in place. \"We don't understand why Germany is stopping this,\" Liebing said. \"It's something that affects German citizens too, when they travel abroad in Europe. If a gay German couple went to an eastern European country, for example, they could find themselves being refused a hotel room. Even in Austria, two lesbians were thrown out of a cafe for kissing.\" Who is holding things up? Germany\n\nAll three of Chancellor Angela Merkel's successive governments have failed to even offer an explanation for their position. \"The government has just not faced the issue,\" said Liebing. \"There is no official position, and the issue doesn't come up in the coalition contract at all.\" Amnesty thinks the Chancellery is still harboring reservations\n\nWhen DW asked the government for a statement, Family Ministry spokeswoman Verena Herb said: \"The consultations within the government have not yet been completed. That is why we have not yet taken a position on the matter in Brussels.\" The junior partner in the current coalition government, the Social Democratic Party, has said it is in favor of the directive, which suggests the Chancellery still harbors reservations - though what they are is anyone's guess as it has not said anything on the topic. \"A first step would be for them to explain why they have a problem with this issue,\" said Liebing. Should the law be passed in Europe, EU member states would have to adopt the legislation at a national level. Different countries would have to make different adjustments - but broadening disability access would likely be one of the largest areas. Currently there is some movement. The European Commission has recently made the issue a priority, again, and wants to finally put a bill before the European Parliament - if Merkel's government will let that happen."}
{"text": "SEATTLE, WA, November 21, 2017 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The extinction of salmon is a real threat that must be stopped. The construction of dams and water diversions has done irreversible damage, blocking the natural passage of the salmon. Activities like gravel mining, logging and urban development have also seen the returns on salmon dip sharply. Dam operators are spending billions and are frustrated with the current direction, with minimal results towards the threat. This is where Northwest Fisheries Enhancement would make a perfect fit, and hopefully dam operators will back NWFE. This is why NWFE is launching this all out crowdfunding campaign to save the salmon. The Seattle Times argues that budget cuts proposed by President Donald Trump will essentially put an end to funding for salmon recovery, leaving state and local resources strained, and endangering the species even further. With an increasing reliance on imported fish, and shrinking jobs in hatcheries and fisheries every day, it is clear a salmon extinction will be devastating. Salmon are an important way of life. Rivers full of salmon mean a healthy ecosystem. Alive, the salmon check the levels of algae and smaller fish. When they die, the nutrients from their bodies nurture forests and the ecosystem at large. It goes full circle. Not only does their movement bring nutrients to our rivers and shores, they are a big pull for tourists and they create jobs for locals. They are a cornerstone of culture, diet, economy and our environment. Northwest Fisheries Enhancement seeks to actively play a role in stopping the extinction of salmon. It is a non-profit organization whose approach is geared towards salmon recovery. It will do this through:\n\n- Developing partnerships that offer hatchery owners competitive management options without relying too heavily on the government. - Strengthening and building Community Fisheries Organizations (CFOs) to help improve Salmon and Steelhead returns to their rivers. - Meeting responsible and modern practices for Hatchery options and Wild/ Natural Origin Salmon with New and Proven models. You can join the efforts to save salmon from extinction today. It is a solid, reasonable investment, as shown by the Seattle Times in March 2017. By restoring watersheds and other projects, investing in the recovery of salmon created more than 16 jobs for every 1 Million dollars. The money remains in the local county too, meaning more can be done with it. It is the the intention of NWFE to help Community Fisheries Organizations (CFO) with Salmon and Steelhead egg, fry and smolt plantings and re-introduction into their rivers and streams by the millions. There are hundreds if not thousands of River and streams where CFO's can make a difference in saving and returning salmon and Steelhead runs. NWFE will provide hatchery management for hatchery owners, improving their Salmon and Steelhead smolt releases by the millions, decreasing management costs and improving efficiency. By donating to the cause now, you are saving the jobs of the people who work daily with the salmon. This is the surest way to eliminate the loss of salmon through mismanagement. Take matters into your own hands; join Northwest Fisheries Enhancement in creating real change.

{"text": "From Artificial Intelligence and connected objects to bots, Bluetooth and RFIDs \u2013 the demand for IoT technology is increasing more than ever in Canada, according to a report from IDC. Beta Kit reported that with the costs of connected devices going down, around 50% of mid to large Canadian businesses adopted or intend to adopt at least one IoT solution between 2016 and 2017. And even though the United States seems to be leading the pack, there are many factors indicating that Canada is right behind it. According to last year\u2019s report from Brookfield Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship:\n\nThe tech sector was directly responsible for $117 billion or 7.1 percent of Canada\u2019s economic output, greater than that of the finance and insurance industry. 864,000 Canadians were employed in the tech sector, which made up 5.6 percent of Canada\u2019s total employment. At over $9.1 billion, the tech sector was by far the largest private sector investor in research and development. The tech sector was also comprised of nearly 71,000 firms that year, representing 6.1 percent of all Canadian businesses. Tech sector employees earned approximately $67,000 a year, compared to the national average of nearly $48,000. The scenario is definitely promising. Whether you\u2019re a startup looking to disrupt an industry or an established company looking into generating more revenue, there are endless reasons to invest in the Internet of Things (IoT), especially in mobile. Canada is already seen as a leader in technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, and companies like Google and Uber are already aware of the opportunities: as we mentioned in our past blog post, they\u2019re heavily investing in their own AI hubs in Toronto. According to Jennifer Sewell, Product Marketing Manager at mnubo, \u201cIoT and AI have positioned Canada as an innovative hot bed. But more importantly, it is opening the door for entrepreneurs.

{"text": "Buy Photo Navajo Nation Council Delegate Leonard Tsosie speaks during a presentation before the start of the spring session on April 18 in Window Rock, Ariz. (Photo: Noel Lyn Smith/The Daily Times)Buy Photo\n\nFARMINGTON \u2014 A new bill is asking Navajo lawmakers to place a referendum before tribal voters, asking them to approve consolidating the nation's 110 chapters into a regional government structure. The bill, which was posted July 9 on the Navajo Nation Council's website, asks the council to place the referendum on the Nov. 8 general election ballot. The referendum would require a simple majority of votes in order to pass, according to the bill. If voters approved the measure, it would consolidate the current 110 chapters into 24 regional governments. It would also eliminate the positions of chapter president, vice president and secretary-treasurer and replace those positions with elected commissioners. The proposed ballot language explains that chapters with fewer than 1,000 registered voters would be represented by one commissioner, and chapters with more than 1,000 registered voters would be represented by two commissioners. There are 11 chapters in the Northern Agency that have more than a 1,000 registered voters, according to the Navajo Election Administration office in Shiprock. The chapters would remain as nongovernmental communities, and the transition would occur within four years, the bill states. Delegate Leonard Tsosie, who represents the Baca-Prewitt, Casamero Lake, Counselor, Littlewater, Ojo Encino, Pueblo Pintado, Torreon and Whitehorse Lake chapters, is sponsoring the bill. The bill was assigned to the Resources and Development and Naa'bik'\u00edy\u00e1ti' committees and to the council, where final authority rests. In a telephone interview Thursday, Tsosie said the referendum was developed based on a recommendation from the Title 26 Codification Task Force Committee. The task force was formed by the Resources and Development Committee in May 2015, and membership includes personnel from the Office of Navajo Government Development, the Land Department, the Department of Justice, the Office of the Auditor General and other entities. If regional governments were established, the amount the tribe allocates to chapters for administrative and operational costs could be reduced and funds to provide services at the local level increased, Tsosie said. The total amount of funding distributed in the fiscal year budget is divided among the 110 chapters, according to the Office of Management and Budget. For the proposed fiscal year 2017 budget, the Budget and Finance Committee recommends approximately $11.8 million for nonadministrative costs, approximately $3.8 million for capital infrastructure and $13.7 million for operational costs, according to figures provided by the OMB. Chapters also receive sales tax revenue, which is also divided between the 110 chapters, according to the OMB. Earlier in the year, the Office of Navajo Government Development held public education sessions to present information about amending the chapter government system. Tsosie said he attended a number of sessions and heard several comments opposing the change. \"It's an idea, and I've been telling chapters to give it a chance. \u2026We hope the people will give it a serious evaluation,\" he said. After the standing committees consider the bill, it could go before the council during a special session in August, Tsosie added. Noel Lyn Smith covers the Navajo Nation for The Daily Times.

{"text": "Police have released photos of a man suspected of sexually assaulting a woman in the Edgewater neighborhood on the North Side. The assault happened about 5:40 a.m. on Oct. 26 in an alley on the 5600 block of North Kenmore Avenue, police said. The woman was walking in the alley when a man approached her and struck her numerous times in the head, police said. The man robbed her and tried to sexually assault her.

{"text": "CNN - The CIA's News Network? By Dave McGowan\n\nMay 2000\n\nI n February of this year, a story that had appeared in the European press was reported by Alexander Cockburn - co-editor of Counterpunch - concerning the employment by CNN of military psychological warfare specialists. Other than Cockburn's piece, and the issuance of an 'Action Alert' by the media-watchdog group FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting), the report was ignored by the American press. As originally reported by Abe de Vries in the Dutch periodical Trouw, the story went something like this: \"For a short time last year, CNN employed military specialists in 'psychological operations' (psyops). This was confirmed to Trouw by a spokesman of the U.S. Army. The military could have influenced CNN's news reports about the crisis in Kosovo.\" (1)\n\nCould have? The word 'duh' would seem to apply here. In fact, here's a news flash: the military influenced the news reports of all the media outlets that covered the Kosovo bombardment. The only news coming from the area was coming from NATO and the Pentagon. When you are the sole source of information, you tend to have a lot of influence. But that's not the issue here. The concern here is with CNN hiring military personnel to package for viewers the information provided as 'news' by other military personnel. This is said to be a most disturbing development, and I suppose it would be were it not for the fact that the U.S. media - as a whole - is infested with so many intelligence assets that it is hard to see how a few more in the mix could make much of a difference. Of course, most of them are posing as reporters, editors, news anchors, analysts, producers, publishers, etc. The difference here is that these particular spooks were employed openly at CNN, without journalistic cover. As Major Thomas Collins, of the U.S. Army Information Service acknowledged:\n\n\"Psyops personnel, soldiers and officers, have been working in CNN's headquarters in Atlanta through our programme 'Training With Industry'. They worked as regular employees of CNN. Conceivably, they would have worked on stories during the Kosovo war. They helped in the production of news.\" (1)\n\nThe phrase \"production of news\" is notably ambiguous when used in this context. It could easily be defined as the manufacture of news. Manufacturing news is, in fact, exactly what psychological warfare specialists do. As de Vries notes:\n\n\"The military CNN personnel belonged to the airmobile Fourth Psychological Operations Group, stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. One of the main tasks of this group of almost 1200 soldiers and officers is to spread 'selected information'. [We should pause here, briefly, to note that in this context, the phrase 'selected information' generally means vicious distortions and outright lies.] \"American psyops troops try with a variety of techniques to influence media and public opinion in armed conflicts in which American state interests are said to be at stake. [We need to pause again to note that 'American state interests' generally means the financial interests of U.S. monopoly capitalists.] The propaganda group was involved in the Gulf war, the Bosnian war and the crisis in Kosovo.\" (1)\n\nIn other words, they did during the war in Kosovo what they have always done. This time, however, they did it more openly. This could have proven to be a major blunder for CNN, with scores of competitors airing this story to embarrass and discredit a rival. But that would require that we have some actual semblance of a free press. Instead, what happened was that the story got a couple of brief mentions in the alternative press that were easily overlooked and ignored. And this was only after the translated article began appearing on internet sites, most notably on the Emperor's Clothes. Had this not been the case, the story likely would not have surfaced at all on these shores. Nor would a follow-up article by de Vries in the same publication a few days later. De Vries refers to the Commander of the Fourth Psychological Operations Group, Colonel Cristopher St. John, who described the cooperation with CNN as \"a textbook example of the kind of ties the American army wants to have with the media.\" (2)\n\nThe kind of ties that will allow it \"to spread handpicked 'information' and keep other news quiet, ... to control the internet, to wage electronic warfare against disobedient media, and to control commercial satellites.\" (2) Most of which, it should be noted, the intelligence community already does to varying degrees. Still, the control is not yet complete enough. De Vries reports that the psyops personnel were not completely satisfied with the Kosovo operation: \"In their opinion, too much information about the unplanned results of the bombings has come to the surface. [We must pause yet again to note that 'unplanned results of the bombings' refers to the entirely foreseeable civilian carnage.] Rear Admiral Thomas Steffens of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) reportedly would like to have the capacity to bring down an 'informational cone of silence' over areas where special operations are in place. What that can mean in reality was shown by the bombing of the Serbian state television RTS in Belgrade.\" (2)\n\nIndeed. And speaking of the bombing of the Serbian television station, there was another story that ran in the European press concerning that particular incident which also happened to cast CNN in a particularly bad light. Considerably more so than the story told in the Dutch publication, in fact. Significantly, this story was not aired at all in the United States. It did appear, however, in the U.K., in an article by corespondent Robert Fisk in The Independent. The report reveals that:\n\n\"Two days before NATO bombed the Serb Television headquarters in Belgrade, CNN received a tip from its Atlanta headquarters that the building was to be destroyed. They were told to remove their facilities from the premises at once, which they did.\" (3)\n\nApparently it helps to have those psyops specialists on board. Fisk goes on to recount that the next day, Aleksander Vucic, the Serbian Information Minister, received an invitation to appear on the Larry King Live show, ostensibly to give Larry's audience the Serbian view of the conflict via satellite. There were two rather serious problems with this invitation, however. First, the notion that CNN would invite a Serbian official on the air to give the Serb point of view is rather far-fetched, to say the least. More importantly, the studio to which Vucic had been invited was now deserted. Nevertheless, he was asked to arrive for makeup at 2:00AM for a 2:30AM appearance. \"Vucic was late - which was just as well for him since NATO missiles slammed into the building at six minutes past two. The first one exploded in the make-up room where the young Serb assistant was burned to death. CNN calls this all a coincidence, saying that the Larry King show, put out by the entertainment division, did not know of the news department's instruction to its men to leave the Belgrade building.\" (3)\n\nCNN's explanation is, of course, preposterous. In fact, the notion that there is some kind of distinction between CNN's 'entertainment division' and its 'news department' is rather preposterous as well. The truth appears to be that CNN was directly complicit in the attempted commission of a war crime. And this action was, to be sure, a war crime. The deliberate targeting of a foreign dignitary for assassination - even in time of war - is definitely an international war crime. So it appears that our media have crossed the line from complicity in the covering-up of U.S. war crimes - which has been a mainstay of the press for decades - to complicity in the actual commission of war crimes. A rather serious transgression, one would think, yet one which has been politely overlooked by the rest of the American media outlets. This is quite likely due to the fact that the intelligence community and corporate America pretty much controls all the media. That is why even when stories such as the CNN/Psyops reports emerge in the 'progressive' media, albeit in a very limited way, they are accompanied by amusing commentary and analysis intended to downplay the significance of the incident. For example, Cockburn wonders if: \"It could be that CNN was the target of a psyops penetration and is still too na\u00efve to figure out what was going on.\" (4) To the contrary, it appears that CNN was well aware of - and actively participating in - \"what was going on.\" Similarly, for FAIR what is \"especially troubling is the fact that the network allowed the Army's covert propagandists to work in its headquarters, where they learned the ins and outs of CNN's operations. Even if the psyops officers working in the newsroom did not influence news reporting, did the network allow the military to conduct an intelligence-gathering mission against CNN itself?\" (5)\n\nOr, more likely, is CNN itself an \"intelligence gathering mission,\" and has it been from its inception? It was CNN, it will be recalled, that pioneered the concept of military conflict as mini-series - complete with theme music and title graphics - during the Gulf War. That is, of course, the blueprint that has been followed by the media at large for all coverage of U.S. military actions since then. One of the specific purposes for which CNN seems to have been born is the packaging of imperialist military conquests as humanitarian missions. In other words, \"to spread 'selected information'\" in order to \"influence media and public opinion in armed conflicts in which American state interests are said to be at stake.\" Glorification of U.S. high-tech weaponry, vilification of America's enemy of the moment, canonization of genocidal military leaders and advisers, rote reporting of the NATO/Pentagon/State Department line, deliberate avoidance of reporting clear-cut cases of American brutality and war crimes - all of these are indicative of a psyops program, not an allegedly independent news agency. As the group FAIR noted: \"CNN has always maintained a close relationship with the Pentagon. Getting access to top military officials is a necessity for a network that stakes its reputation on being first on the ground during wars and other military operations.\" (5)\n\nBeing first on the ground during military operations is, to be sure, a good place to be if one is a reporter. It is also a good place to be, it should be noted, if one is a member of the spook community. Whether CNN was born as an intelligence front is probably now largely an irrelevant issue, as the cable titan has since the Kosovo war announced that it is to become a part of the AOL family. And AOL is, as was noted in a recent Spin Cycle article (Sony's Magic Cameras), doing a pretty damn good job of masquerading as an intelligence front itself. So if CNN was not originally conceived as a psychological warfare entity (which appears to be the case, despite its purported status as the brainchild of Ted Turner, husband of Jane Fonda), it has certainly evolved into one. And by the way, does anyone remember when Jane was supposed to be one of the good guys? Just checking."}
